# OBJECTIVE:
# Implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting.
# If the greeting starts with “hello”, output $0.
# If the greeting starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), output $20.
# Otherwise, output $100. Ignore any leading whitespace in the user’s greeting,
# and treat the user’s greeting case-insensitively.

# Reference link: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp
# ADDITIONAL NOTES:
# the . is used to call a method on a string
# a method is a function that belongs to a class

# STEPS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM:
# 1. ask the user a question
# 2. store the answer in a variable
# 3. format the string to remove leading whitespace
# 4. format the string to lowercase
# 5. check if the answer starts with "hello"
# 6. if the answer starts with "hello", print "$0"
# 7. check if the answer starts with "h"
# 8. if the answer starts with "h", print "$20"
# 9. otherwise, print "$100"
# remember to call the main function at the end of the program

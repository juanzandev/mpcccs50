    # Start an infinite loop to continuously accept input from the user.

        # Use a try-except block to handle the end of input gracefully.

            # Read input from the user, expecting a fruit name as a string.

            # Check if the fruit is already in the dictionary.

                # If the fruit exists, increment its count by 1.

                # If the fruit does not exist in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1.

        # Handle the EOFError to break out of the loop, which occurs when there's no more input.

            # Print a newline for formatting before exiting the loop.

    # Extract the keys from the items dictionary and sort them.

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the sorted items.

    # Iterate over the sorted keys.

        # Assign the value from the original items dictionary to the sorted_keys dictionary, maintaining order.

    # Iterate over the sorted_keys dictionary items.

        # Print the count and the fruit name in uppercase, separated by a space.

# Call the main function to run the program.

This is a very short problem.
Learn how to import a library; in this case, the name is emoji. Go to the hints section of the problem and install the library using the instructions they give you.
Create a variable to store the user's input. https://pypi.org/project/emoji/
Then print "Output: " + the variable, but it is a bit trickier than that.
To use a library's function, you must precede the method you want to use with the library's name.
I. e: if there is a library called math and you want to use the addition function, you would write it like this
    math.addition()
'''
import ?
def main():
  # input_variable = input()
  # print(?)
  # Hint: be careful when you read what the function emojize does and how to use it. It may not be as obvious as it sounds. You could totally take a different approach to this problem, and if you do, please let me know

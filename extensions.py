# Implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a file and then outputs that file’s media type if the file’s name ends,
# case-insensitively, in any of these suffixes:

# .gif
# .jpg
# .jpeg
# .png
# .pdf
# .txt
# .zip
# Else, return application/octet-stream


# STEPS TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM:
# 1. prompt the user for the name of a file
# 2. convert the file name to lowercase and get rid of any leading or trailing whitespace
# 3. check if the file name ends with the suffixes
# 4. if the file name ends with the suffixes, print the media type
# 5. if the file name does not end with the suffixes, print the default media type
# 6. remember to check the reference for string methods: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods
# 7. remember to check the reference for if statement: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if
# 8. remember to check the reference for input function: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input
# 9. remember to check the reference for print function: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print
# HINTS:
# 1. you won't need to create multiple fuctions for this program
# 2. you won't need to use any modules for this program
# 3. you won't need to use any loops for this program
# 4. you won't need to use any conditional expressions for this program such as ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=.

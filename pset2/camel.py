# STEPS:

# Prompt the user for a variable name in camel case.
# Initialize an empty string to hold the snake case result.
# Iterate through each character in the user input.
    # If the character is uppercase, append an underscore to the snake case string.
    # Append the current character in lowercase to the snake case string.
# Print the final snake case string.

# TIPS
# String Iteration: Remember how to loop through each character in a string.
# String Methods: Familiarize yourself with string methods like isupper() and lower().
# Conditional Statements: Understand how to use if statements to execute code only under certain conditions.
# String Concatenation: Practice building a new string by appending characters or substrings to it.
# Testing and Debugging: Test your solution with various camel case inputs to ensure it handles all scenarios correctly.

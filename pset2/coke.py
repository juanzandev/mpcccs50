# STEPS

# Define the main function of the program.
    # Initialize a variable to track the total amount paid by the user.
    # Define a constant for the total amount due.
    # Initialize the variable to track the remaining amount due, initially equal to the total due.
    # Define a list of accepted coin denominations.

    # Start a loop that runs until the paid amount is at least as much as the total due.
        # Print the current amount due to inform the user.
        # Prompt the user to insert a coin and store the input as an integer.
        
        # Check if the inserted coin is in the list of accepted denominations.
            # If it is, add the value of the coin to the total paid amount.
            # Update the amount still due by subtracting the total paid amount from the total due.

    # After exiting the loop, print the change owed to the user by subtracting the total due from the total paid.

# Check if the current file is the main program and call the main function to execute the program.

# TIPS:
# Understand the Problem: Before jumping into coding, make sure to understand what the problem is asking. Break it down into smaller parts if needed.

# Pseudocode: Before writing actual code, jot down the steps in pseudocode. This helps organize thoughts and structures the solution.

# Think about Edge Cases: Consider how your program should handle unusual or extreme inputs, like negative numbers or very large inputs.

# Test Incrementally: After writing a piece of code, test it to make sure it works before moving on to the next part.

# Review and Refactor: Once your code works, review it. Look for ways to make it cleaner or more efficient.

# Ask for Help if Stuck: Encourage collaboration. Sometimes, discussing with peers or mentors can provide a new perspective.

# STEPS
# Define the main function.
    # Create a list of vowels for comparison.
    # Prompt the user for input and store the input string.
    # Initialize an empty string to build the output (without vowels).

    # Loop through each character in the input string.
        # Check if the current character is not a vowel (consider both uppercase and lowercase).
            # If it's not a vowel, append it to the output string.

    # Print the output string which excludes vowels.

# Ensure that the script runs the main function when executed.

# TIPS
# String Immutability: Understand that strings in Python are immutable. Modifying a string actually creates a new string.
# Iterate with Caution: Be cautious when iterating over a collection and modifying it at the same time. It can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
# Building Strings: Learn how to build strings incrementally, which is often more efficient in Python than modifying the original string.
# Test Edge Cases: Always test your code with different inputs, including edge cases like empty strings or strings without vowels.

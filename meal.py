def main():
    # FIRST PART
    # initialize a variable called time
    # ask the user a question
    # store the answer in a variable
    # call the convert function and pass in the time variable. store the return value in a variable

    # THIRD PART
    # use an if statement to check for desired conditions
    # if hours is between 7.00 and 8.00, print "breakfast time"
    # if hours is between 12.00 and 13.00, print "lunch time"
    # if hours is between 18.00 and 19.00, print "dinner time"
    # otherwise, print "not meal time"

def convert(time):
    #SECOND PART
    # convert the time to a float. The float should be 7.5 if the time is 7:30
    # split the time into hours and minutes. reference for string methods: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods
    # convert the hours and minutes into floats
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # EXTRA CREDIT:
    # if minutes is higher than 59, the user should be told that the time is invalid and the program ends there.
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # return the sum of the hours and minutes divided by 60. (only divide minutes by 60, not the entire thing).
